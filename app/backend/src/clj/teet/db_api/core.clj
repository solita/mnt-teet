  Arguments:
  command-name   The namespaced keyword name of the command.
  options        Map of options (see below).
  body           Code that implements the command.

  Options:
  :doc            Docstring for the command

  :payload        Required binding form for command payload data

  :context        Optional binding form for the execution context
                  that always includes: db, user and conn.

  :config         Optional binding for configuration values.
                  If provided, it must be a map from local name to vector path
                  in configuration.

  :unauthenticated?
                  If true, allow unauthenticated requests. Skips authorization
                  and project id checks completely.

  :authorization  Required map of authorization rules to check (see below)

  :project-id     Required form to determine the project for which
                  user permissions are checked. May use the bindings
                  from payload or context.

  :pre            Optional vector of pre check forms. Can use bindings
                  from context and payload. If pre checks fail, the request
                  will return a bad request reponse without invoking the
                  body (or transact). If the check form has metadata key
                  :error, then that will be sent to the client, otherwise
                  a generic error code is sent.

  :post           Optional vector of post check forms. In addition to pre
                  check bindings, forms can also use % to refer to the
                  command result value. If post checks fail, the request
                  will return an internal server error response and log
                  an error.

  :transact       Optional form that generates data to transact to
                  Datomic. If specified, body must be omitted.
                  The command will automatically return the tempids
                  as the result when transact is used.


  Authorization rules:
  Each authorization rule key defines a rule that is in the authorization matrix.
  The value of the rule is an options map that defines the :db/id of entity that
  will be checked of ownership if the authorization matrix requires it.

  By default the permission requires :full access. To override use :permission
  key to specify the access (eg. :read for read-only).

  If command can have access to own items (with :link access type). The :db/id
  (or :eid) must be specified for the entity. The map may contain :link keyword which
  specifies which ref attribute is checked against the current user. The link
  attribute defaults to :meta/creator if omitted.
