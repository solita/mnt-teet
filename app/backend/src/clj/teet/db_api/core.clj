  Arguments:
  command-name   The namespaced keyword name of the command.
  options        Map of options (see below).
  body           Code that implements the command.

  Options:
  :payload        Required binding form for command payload data
  :context        Optional binding form for the execution context
                  that always includes: db, user and conn.
  :authorization  Required map of authorization rules to check (see below)
  :project-id     Required form to determine the project for which
                  user permissions are checked. May use the bindings
                  from payload or context.
  :transact       Optional form that generates data to transact to
                  Datomic. If specified, body must be omitted.
                  The command will automatically return the tempids
                  as the result when transact is used.


  Authorization rules:
  Each authorization rule key defines a rule that is in the authorization matrix.
  The value of the rule is an options map that defines the :db/id of entity that
  will be checked of ownership if the authorization matrix requires it.

  By default the permission requires :full access. To override use :permission
  key to specify the access (eg. :read for read-only).

  If command can have access to own items (with :link access type). The :db/id
  must be specified for the entity. The :meta/creator is checked and compared
  to the user id.
