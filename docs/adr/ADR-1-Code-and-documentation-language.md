# ADR-1 Language used in source code and documentation

## Context
TEET is a multi-site project that will have development work done both in Oulu and Tallinn
offices. The developers and customer do not have the same native language.



## Decision

Code, databases, API definitions and documentation will be in English.

Existing code that is reused from other projects that have different source
language may be used as is if necessary.

All domain concepts must be well defined and updated to a glossary of terms.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences
- Con: customer communication is more difficult because native terms can't be used
- Pro: no lock in to Finnish speaking developers
- Pro: English is the de facto code language
