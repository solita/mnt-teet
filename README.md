`yy` is the last 2 digits of the release year,
`mm` is the release month and
`N` is a sequence number (always starts at 1 for a new year/month pair).

So the first version of january 2020 would be `43.20.01.1`.

- Add the new feature flag to the local config file in the repository which contains it.
