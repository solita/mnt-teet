To run against local dev, you can use the cypress app normally, for example this way

CYPRESS_SITE_PASSWORD=<password here> npx cypress run --config-file cypress-localdev.json

or use the run-in-docker.sh script.

The docker script will also pass any args to cypress so you can eg use:

  ./run-in-docker.sh --spec cypress/integration/login.spec.js # this runs just one spec

# Smoke tests vs CI tests

Some tests require elaborate setup and use controller only available in CI
environment to do setup.

Setup may include creating new projects/tasks that can't be used in an
environment that has integrations.

Tests ending with ".ci.spec.js" should only be run in CI or local test runs.
Other tests can be run in real cloud deployed environment.

There exists three different config files for running cypress: "cypress-ci" is used to run in Github actions,
"cypress-localdev.json" is used to run in a locally run environment and "cypress.json" is used to run against the dev env.
